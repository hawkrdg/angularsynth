		<h1>An Angular Stereo Synth</h1>

		<h3>Setup</h3>

		<p class="helpText">
			This is a drop-in stereo synth for angular/angular material. To use just copy the 'synth' folder into your app code. You also need angular material and either a pre-built theme or one of the themes from 'synth/material/themes/' or your own custom theme. The component has two inputs: [ctx]="yourAudioContext" and [dest]="yourDestination". The destination could be as simple as ctx.destination for the speakers/headphones OR a pannerNode or splitterNode for complex routing to build say a sequencer.
		</p>

		<p class="helpCode">
			/* using a custom theme in styles.styl (or styles.css)... */<br>
		  @import "app/synth/material/themes/brick-light.css"<br><br>

		  &lt;!-- adding it to your app...--&gt;<br>
		  &lt;stereo-synth #synth1 [ctx]="myCtx" [dest]="myDest"&gt;&lt;/stereo-synth&gt;<br><br>

		<h3>Concepts</h3>

		<p class="helpText">
			The synth contains three oscillatorNodes - synthOscillator is the source generator, amLfoOscillator can periodically control the source level, fmLfoOscillator can periodically control the source frequency. The source is connected to a gainNode and the gainNode is connected to the destination. The following diagram shows the node connections:
		</p>

		<p class="helpText">
			Each oscillator has a selection of waveshapes: sine, triangle, sawtooth, and square. The source frequency is controlled by an &lt;input&gt; with a range of 20hz to 20000hz. Both modulation LFO's have a 'percent' fader controlling how much of the gain/frequency is changed and a 'period' fader to control the frequency from 5hz to 0.1hz (ten seconds). Modulations can be toggled on/off. AM modulation will change the level from amPercent to the outputLevel and can go all the way from 0 to outputLevel. FM modulation will change the output frequency both plus and minus the percent * outputFrequency.
		</p>
			These synths are mostly meant to provide 'atmosphere' type sounds, but they could easily be used in a sequencer as the 'tone block' with proper filtering for attack and decay. There would be one synth for each note value in the sequencer.

		<h3>A Simple Example</h3>

		<p class="helpText">
			The example app has two synths connected to the speakers/headphones. Use good quality headphones or good studio monitors to actually hear low frequencies. My el-cheapo speakers cut out at around 90hz, My phones are Tascam TH-02 and let me hear 20hz (my AKG M-70 phones also work but I like the Tascam much better). Two suggested settings for atmosphere are:
		</p>

		<div class="helpCode">
			<p>Example 1:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>synth1 frequency = 100, wave = sine, level = 0.1</li>
				<li>synth1 AM = off</li>
				<li>synth1 FM = on, wave = sawtooth or square, amount = 100%, period = 1 seconds</li>
				<li>synth2 frequency = 35, wave = sine, level = 0.8</li>
				<li>synth2 AM = off</li>
				<li>synth2 FM = on, wave = sine, amount = 15%, period = 5 seconds</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Example 2:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>synth1 frequency = 600, wave = sine, level = 0.05</li>
				<li>synth1 AM = on, wave = square, amount = 100%, period = 1 seconds</li>
				<li>synth1 FM = off</li>
				<li>synth2 frequency = 200, wave = sine, level = 0.5</li>
				<li>synth2 AM = on, wave = sine, amount = 80%, period = 1.2 seconds</li>
				<li>synth2 FM = on, wave = sine, amount = 50%, period = 0.4 seconds</li>
			</ul>
